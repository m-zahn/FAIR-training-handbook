It will explain why FAIR is important and how you can make it happen. Trainers can use the practical suggestions in the following chapters to create or improve their training resources. <10 simple rules image> Figure 1: Ten simple rules for making training materials FAIR. Reproduced under CC-BY-SA 4.0 from 1 . FAIRifying training materials is an individual journey; it\u2019s important to consider your own unique circumstances, settings and context. As you read through the handbook reflect on how FAIR is FAIR enough for you, and from the outset consider: What training materials do you have? Who are you FAIRifying them for? What resourcing, capabilities and capacity do you have? Are there institutional or regulatory considerations? No matter what your setting, there is something you can do to make your training materials FAIRer. What are the FAIR Data principles? Before skipping too far ahead, what are the FAIR Data Principles? The FAIR data principles were published in 2016 2 ; FAIR stands for - F for Findable, A for Accessible, I for interoperable, R for Reusable. The FAIR Data Principles make data more valuable as it is easier to find through unique identifiers and easier to combine and integrate thanks to the formal shared knowledge representation. It\u2019s important to note that the FAIR Data Principles were created to be understood/applied not only by humans but also by machines, in an automated way. More broadly, the FAIR principles describe how research outputs should be organised so they can be more easily accessed, understood, exchanged and reused. The FAIR principles describe a continuum of increasing reusability. How can we translate the FAIR principles to training materials? Preparing training materials is time-consuming and challenging for both new and experienced trainers. Reusing existing materials is a possible solution but it requires that materials have been shared, properly described, and made available (i.e licenced) for reuse by their authors. The bioinformatics training community set out to address these challenges by adapting the FAIR Data Principles to training materials. The result of this community exercise was 10 Simple Rules for Making Training Materials FAIR (Figure 1) 1 . This handbook expands on these rules by providing extra guidance and advice on the process of making your training materials FAIR. FAIR and Open Did you know that \u2018FAIR\u2019 is not the same as \u2018Open\u2019? The FAIR Data motto makes this difference quite clear: \u201cas open as possible, as closed as necessary\u201d. Read more in Chapter 1 . Training materials - what\u2019s in scope? What is a training material and what types of training materials should you consider making FAIR? A simple definition of training material is anything you would produce yourself (or reuse) as a support for your teaching activity. These can be slides, datasets, videos, software, a GitHub repo, a collection of exercises, Virtual Machines (VMs)/Containers, etc. In summary, any digital object that can be used to deliver a lesson, course, curriculum, etc. For more information, please read Chapter 3 . What\u2019s Next? Read the following chapters to discover options for implementing FAIR with your training materials. Your path through this handbook needn\u2019t be linear; jump around the chapters and dip into the ones that are most relevant to you. Consider your own setting and why FAIR is important to you. How FAIR is FAIR enough? That is up to you. Remember that FAIR is a journey and perfection is the enemy of good - FAIRer training materials are better than materials that are not FAIR at all.

Annotating your materials with an extensive narrative so that they can be used as stand-alone materials There is an unresolvable question as to whether material should be self explanatory. For a presentation this would typically require very text heavy slides to capture all aspects of the subject on the slides. It might make the slides also harder to reuse as different audiences might require more or less explanations for a given slide. For lecture-style training materials it is probably better to place detailed content into a handbook or use text-book style reference materials and keep slides for lectures rather clean, only placing relevant elements directly on the slides. The verbal presentation then can fill in the details. You can use the Notes panel in Powerpoint that essentially can take the complete transcript. * Assign basic metadata (author, topic, target audience of the material) to allow the re-user a basic understanding of the context (might overlap with chapter 5?) - Briefly explain metadata and refer to [Chapters 5](chapter_05.md) * What if your materials are a single document (single slide deck / single tutorial / etc.) * How can others contribute - provide examples. 2.2 Prerequisites Chapters 1 and 2 2.3 Keywords Interoperable, file format, README file, Master Doc, reusability 2.4 Learning Outcomes Min, understand - Describe what interoperable formats are Min, apply - Identify suitable document and folder structure Min, apply - Annotate training material with minimal necessary information for re-usability 2.5 Resources How to use Git How to work with others in Git","title":"2.

You can use the Notes panel in Powerpoint that essentially can take the complete transcript. * Assign basic metadata (author, topic, target audience of the material) to allow the re-user a basic understanding of the context (might overlap with chapter 5?) - Briefly explain metadata and refer to [Chapters 5](chapter_05.md) * What if your materials are a single document (single slide deck / single tutorial / etc.) * How can others contribute - provide examples.","title":"Annotating your materials with an extensive narrative so that they can be used as stand-alone materials"},{"location":"chapters/chapter_02/#22-prerequisites","text":"Chapters 1 and 2","title":"2.2 Prerequisites"},{"location":"chapters/chapter_02/#23-keywords","text":"Interoperable, file format, README file, Master Doc, reusability","title":"2.3 Keywords"},{"location":"chapters/chapter_02/#24-learning-outcomes","text":"Min, understand - Describe what interoperable formats are Min, apply - Identify suitable document and folder structure Min, apply - Annotate training material with minimal necessary information for re-usability","title":"2.4 Learning Outcomes"},{"location":"chapters/chapter_02/#25-resources","text":"How to use Git How to work with others in Git","title":"2.5 Resources"},{"location":"chapters/chapter_03/","tags":["Types of training materials","Training Development platform","Archiving","Collaborative development","Repository","GitHub","Markdown","Version control","Content management","Technological platform"],"text":"Authors: Allegra Via Lisanna Paladin .st0{fill:#A6CE39;} .st1{fill:#FFFFFF;} H\u00e9l\u00e8ne Chiapelo Description Here, we will describe a few platforms that can be used to host and share your materials in all four phases of their life cycle (development, delivery, sharing, and archiving), thus ensuring a higher degree of FAIRness.

Supporting materials: LO: Documenting/justifying their choices for a given learning platform Exercise: justify the choice of one or multiple platforms. Supporting materials: Content Introduction Once you have identified what learning experiences (lecture, hands on, exercises, work in groups, etc.), are needed to achieve the learning outcomes of your lesson / course and chosen the most appropriate and FAIR support(s) for the delivery of each of them (e.g. slide deck and/or video for the lecture, pdf for the hands on, shared notes for the work in groups, etc.), you should start considering where you will develop your materials (locally on your computer? or will you rather use a web platform/repository?), from where you will deliver them, how to share them with learners and how you will archive them for recognition and reuse by other instructors. You might decide to develop your materials locally, on your computer, deliver them from your computer (e.g. projecting your local powerpoint), share them by email with learners and archive them on your hard disk and send them to other instructors by email upon request. Despite you might feel comfortable with this \u201cold fashion\u201d approach, you must be aware it is the least FAIR possible. FAIR principles will have a different degree of importance in each of the four phases of the material life cycle (development, delivery, sharing, and archiving. For example, Here, we will describe a few platforms that can be used to host and share your materials in all four phases of their life cycle (development, delivery, sharing, and archiving), thus ensuring a higher degree of FAIRness. The platforms we will discuss are: Google Suite, GitHub and GitLab, Zenodo, Learning Management systems. We chose them as they are free, they include different features, and they are very commonly used in training. We will see which platforms are better to use in each phase of materials life cycle and why and what are the pros and cons of each platform according to FAIR principles. LO: Describe the four phases of training materials life cycle (development, running course, sharing, archiving) Minimum content to achieve the LO: The training materials life cycle is made up of four phases: development, delivery, sharing, and archiving. Phase 1 - Development You may choose to develop your materials locally, on your computer, or you may decide to use a web platform. There are multiple advantages of using a web platform: - Collaborative development - Develop from everywhere at any time - Back up - Start structuring your materials already for the delivery and sharing phases Phase 2 - Delivery You may decide to deliver your materials from your computer, e.g. projecting slides that you stored locally. However, working on a web platform will allow you to [\u2026]. Phase 3 - Sharing Phase 4 - Archiving LO: Describe how to use the Google Suite, GitHub/GitLab, Zenodo, a web portal and a Learning Management System (LMS) Minimum content to achieve the LO: - Google Suite is a Cloud share where people can also work collaboratively, organised in files and folders. It includes different types of documents (slides, sheets, docs). It automatically saves a history of edits for each file, versions can be named to bookmark significant stages. - GitHub and GitLab are git based platforms. Git is a version control system. The common usage of the two platforms would be to sync a local repository with a remote one, which can in turn be cloned and synced from others. Git includes merging/branching/solving conflicts solutions that facilitate collaboration. GitHub and GitLab (the web platforms) include additional features like issues and actions (not covered in detail). - Zenodo is a platform to upload materials of different formats and annotate them with metadata. Each upload corresponds to one version which once uploaded cannot be edited. Uploading to Zenodo allows the assignment of a DOI. - Learning management systems are applications to support the learning, sometimes including assessment and other personalised features. \u201cMoodles\u201d (e.g. Coursera) are LMSs. Usually they have standardised metadata and self-learning features. The materials are not always downloadable. Learning experience: Exercise: think about / share in groups which ones you used in the past and test quickly those you never used to answer the following questions: - Do you need an account to access the platforms? Does your account need permissions to view someone else\u2019s project? - How do you search for someone else\u2019s project on the platform? Does the search include parameters, e.g. date of creation? - How would you add a new project? Is there an option to make it private or accessible only to selected users? - In which of the four phases (development, delivery, sharing, archiving) will the platform \u201caccept\u201d your project? Multiple answers are possible. LO: List the long-term implications of choosing technologies such as Google Suite, GitHub/GitLab, Zenodo, a web portal and a Learning Management System (LMS) LO: Compare the advantages and disadvantages of the platforms in each of the four phases LO: For each phase, explain how to interpret FAIR principles Recap of the four phases: - Materials development (collaborative or not), - Consultation of the training materials by your learners during the course delivery, - Sharing the training materials with learners and potential trainers after completion, - Archiving the training materials to provide long-term reference. Minimum content to achieve the LO: Take into consideration that most of these platforms are not specifically designed for training materials. The platforms shown are differently fit for the different phases, e.g. the Google Suite allows easy collaborative development but, because it is not possible to search for projects that our account is not linked to, it strongly limits the possibilities of sharing. Moreover, the platforms might support in different ways the FAIR principles (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, Reusable) application to training materials, e.g. Zenodo supports findability of materials through rich metadata but the interoperability of these materials (how easy it is to modify, integrate or extend them) strongly depends on the format they are uploaded in. In turn, also the FAIR principles are differently applicable to the four phases, e.g. training materials being findable in the development phase implies being findable by other potential trainers interested in contributing to the development, while in the sharing phase implies being findable to other potential trainers interested in consulting them after completion, for reuse. Potentially, one could compile a three dimensional table to discuss this topic, where the dimensions are: the training platforms, the four letters of FAIR, and the four phases of a project development. In the cells, one could add considerations about if the two dimensions are one fit to the other, and why. The table, decomposed in three two-dimensional tables and pre-filled with the previous examples, could look as follows. Table 1.1 Phases x Platforms Development Running course Sharing Archiving Google Suite YES, easy collaborative development, automatic backup and versioning NO, no way of searching training materials from others GitHub and GitLab Zenodo Coursera (LMSs) Table 1.2 FAIR x Platforms Findable Accessible Interoperable Reusable Google Suite GitHub and GitLab Zenodo YES, rich metadata and search functions NO, if materials are uploaded in non-editable formats Coursera (LMSs) Google Suite Table 1.3 Phases x FAIR Development Running course Sharing Archiving Findable YES, if the aim is to involve other trainers in the development process YES, to allow other potential trainers to reuse the materials or students to access them after the course Accessible Interoperable Reusable Learning experience: Exercise: Fill (alone or in groups) table 1.3, \u201cPhases x FAIR\u201d. LO: For each phase, identify platforms that best comply with the FAIR principles according to user\u2019s needs and priorities In the discussion above, you might be more interested in considering a specific phase (because, for example, that\u2019s the phase where your course is in) or a specific letter of FAIR (because, for example, you have been asked by your institution to improve that aspect of your training materials). Your aim is to understand which platforms would better comply with either one or the other, so basically to focus on specific row(s) of the other two tables. There is not one solution that works for all cases, and FAIRification is a process that starts from your priorities and implies the adoption of increasingly better practices to achieve them, and enhance the quality of your training materials. Learning experience: Take the time to consider your needs. Exercise: Highlight the columns in tables 1.2 \u201cPhases x Platforms\u201d and 1.3 \u201cFAIR x Platforms\u201d that you consider more relevant for your specific case. Fill each column consulting all the platforms, especially those that you never used. LO: Documenting/justifying their choices for a given learning platform Learning experience: Justify your choices. Exercise: By looking at the tables you filled in the previous learning activity, choose one platform (or more, for different phases). Justify your choice by comparing the advantages and disadvantages of that platform with the others.","title":"3.

We will provide guidelines for choosing a repository and making your materials accessible to as many people as possible (inclusive). Learning Outcomes Learning outcomes At the end of this chapter you should be able to: Define what accessible means in the context of FAIR Explain the relevance of accessibility to FAIR Training Materials Explain the different levels of access Min, apply: Describe access requirements using clear language Choose the appropriate level of access for your training materials, including depositing your materials in a FAIR way Describe access to your materials using clear language Explain what is meant by accessibility for inclusiveness Accessibility in the context of FAIR Accessibility refers to the ability to retrieve content. Accessibility defines who, when, where (via a web site, a repository) and how (using a login, programmatically via an API, etc.) to access training materials. In your journey towards making your training materials FAIR [1], you will probably need to consider whether you need to restrict the accessibility to your training materials. Why is accessibility important Training material which is accessible to trainees prior to a course lets them take a look and helps them to prepare for the course. During the course, it means all trainees benefit from training materials and participate in hands-on exercises. By allowing trainees to access the materials after the course, they can review it at their own pace, redo exercises, and consolidate their knowledge. By extending the accessibility of the materials to trainees who did not follow the course, you promote the opportunity of recruiting future trainees, and you may favour self-learning for people that weren\u2019t able to attend a training session. By making your training materials accessible to other trainers, you give them the opportunity to view the materials and possibly be inspired by them, or even to reuse them in their own courses (see Chapter 8 Licensing). Trainers who reuse your material may even provide feedback (possibling improving the materials) or even collaborating with you to develop further training materials. Another incentive to making your training materials accessible is to point out the work you have done, for instance for funding bodies or hiring committees. For trainers who have received public funding to create training materials, this provides a way to illustrate the use of the funds. How to access Ideally, data and training material should be accessible using standard protocols (http, api, etc.), as well as possibly using fully automated protocols (such as scrapers or crawlers). Anyone with a computer and an internet connection should be able to obtain a description of the training materials and who to contact, without necessarily having access to the materials themselves. In other words, you should be able to view and (down)load the metadata (see Chapter 4) without specialised tools. Therefore, a unique identifier (see Chapter 5) and the location (see Chapter 9) where the training material is stored, are essential elements. That said, access to training materials may be open or limited. Consider the following levels of access: 1. Open access : The training materials are shared publicly. Anyone can access the materials. 2. Registered access : Anyone can access the materials provided they register beforehand and agree to the terms and conditions. 3. Controlled access : Only specific persons can access the materials after requesting and being granted access. Depending on the repository you choose (see Chapter 3), access to the material will differ. Table 1 Access x Platforms Access level Accessible to Access Timeframe Access from Google Suite Open or controlled access (editing, suggesting, viewing) Anyone with the link or access rights Anytime Web page GitHub and GitLab Open or controlled access (editing, pull requests, viewing) Anyone can view; access rights are required for pull requests and editing Anytime Web page, programmatic (API), Git Zenodo Open or controlled (restricted) access Anyone (open access) or anyone with the approval of the depositor (restricted access) Anytime provided there is no embargo Web page, programmatic access (API) LMSs (Coursera, Moodle) Open, registered or controlled access Anyone (open access), anyone registered (active account) or with access rights (restricted access) Anytime provided the materials are not hidden Web page Choosing the appropriate level of access When considering the level of access that is appropriate, you should consider the setting in which the training materials are being used. The level of access will not be the same if the training materials you design are for a private company, if they are part of a university curriculum where the fees include access to the material or if they contain sensitive data, such patient information. In such cases, limiting the access is both needed and required. Authentication and authorisation can be used to achieve this. This may require the help of the administrator of the learning management system or an IT for a web site. Restrictions can refer to a user account with user-specific rights, restricted domains (e.g., a university can give access to training material to their students), or paid options (content is only available for a fee). As in a publication where all authors have to have read and agreed on the content, all authors should be consulted when evaluating the level of access. Institutions or funding bodies may also specify the level of access of any materials created, so you should consider this as well. In the context of FAIR, training material does not have to be open exclusively. Even restricted data comply with the FAIR principles as long as accessibility requirements are defined properly. Exercise Learning experience: Search for training material online and analyse how accessible it is and to whom. (in groups, 10 mins, 5 min search, 5 min wrap-up) Describing the access to your materials By describing who can access your materials and how in a clear manner, you indicate to anyone wishing to access them how they can do so. You should clearly state the level of access as part of the metadata (see Chapter 4). Obviously, you should also state the accessibility rules in plain English in the same location as your materials so that others know how to get access. Note If you are using an authentication system to restrict access or collect usage data, it is important to include data-protection information, either as part of the material documentation or the hosting website disclaimers. Let\u2019s see how this can be done. Have you ever come across course material in Zenodo tagged as Open access? This clearly indicates that there are no restrictions to access the materials. Or maybe a colleague has talked to you about a course available in coursera? As you will be asked to enrol before accessing the materials, access is restricted and limited to the time that the course is running. Accessibility for inclusiveness Have you ever considered that your training material may not be understood by your trainees? Language may constitute a barrier to accessing learning material. This can be addressed by providing training materials in different languages, including metadata, in the same way that Wikipedia offers articles on the same topic in numerous languages\u201d or the Carpentries [2] that so far provide lessons in different languages. You should also consider making your training materials accessible for those with specific needs [3]. For instance, someone with poor eyesight might appreciate the possibility of making text larger, whereas someone who is colour-blind might not interpret images the same way as someone who is not. You should consider consulting resources which provide colour-blind slide models or fonts suitable for people with dyslexia which improve reading comprehension and reading speed by making characters more distinct [4].

This information is an important part of the metadata and should be included alongside the materials. We consider existing metadata recommendations for training materials and different ways of representing this information in a detailed but logical and useful format. There are other factors that influence the reusability of training materials including the format and design of the training materials, where they are shared, and the licence that is assigned to them. These topics are covered in - Chapter 2: Structure materials for FAIRness , Chapter 3 - Getting ready to create your materials for reuse and Chapter 8 - Licensing . In this chapter training materials can be either an individual training material (e.g. a dataset, slides) or a collection of materials associated with a particular training session. Prerequisites How you manage the metadata associated with your training materials depends on where and in what format you are sharing your materials. It\u2019s recommended that you read Chapter 2: Structure materials for FAIRness and Chapter 3 - getting ready reate your materials for reuse before starting on this chapter. Related chapters: Chapter 2: Structure materials for FAIRness Chapter 3: Getting ready to create your materials for reuse Chapter 4: Metadata and annotation Chapter 8 - Licensing Keywords Metadata, contextual information, reusability, learning outcomes Learning Outcomes By the end of this chapter, learners will be able to: List the information which will allow other trainers to reuse training materials Identify the most suitable information to allow others to reuse their training materials Write learning outcomes that clearly articulate training goals Choose a suitable method for sharing contextual information about their training materials. Construct a detailed description (run sheet/recipe) which will allow others to reuse their training materials Introduction Imagine you have made the most delicious cake ever to be created. Perhaps it is a multi-layered chocolate cake with cream and cherries on top. Believing that food is better when shared, you want to make sure that your friends and family can make it too. How would you go about doing this? You\u2019d likely start with a recipe. This recipe would include a description of the cake, a list of ingredients and equipment, and instructions on how to combine the ingredients. You might also include extra information like how many people it serves or tips on steps that can be done ahead of time. Your friend decides to bake the cake but they can\u2019t eat cherries and don\u2019t have some of the ingredients and equipment that you have. They decide to experiment by substituting ingredients and methods from another recipe to make their own perfect chocolate cake. The same is true for training. The training session can be thought of as the cake, the training materials are the ingredients, and the methods are instructions on how to combine and use the materials to deliver the training. Training materials and sessions can be (re)used in whole, in part or simply as inspiration. Regardless, when reusing training materials it is likely that they will need to be adapted to new contexts to account, for example, for different audiences and settings. To enable others to reuse your materials it\u2019s important to provide a detailed recipe. What to include in your recipe Learning activity: What to include in your recipe In this activity we consider what types of information to include in a training recipe. Find three examples of training materials relevant to your field. This may be an individual training material or a training session. (Alternatively, take a look at some of the case studies linked below). What information is included in the training recipe for these materials? Is the same information provided in all three examples? Would you need more information to decide whether you could reuse them and how? Information about training sessions and materials is referred to as metadata . Metadata makes it easier for you and others to understand how a particular material or set of materials can be (re)used. Making training FAIR requires materials and sessions to be described with rich metadata. Ideally, this includes a universally agreed set of information. Many training communities, including Bioschemas and the Research Data Alliance (RDA) 1 , are working towards defining these sets of information but broad agreement on the categories to be included is yet to be reached. In our paper 10 simple rules for making training materials FAIR 2 we used the Bioschema and RDA sets to create a list of the information (metadata) that is important for training materials. Table 1: Metadata that is important for training materials and guidance on what to include in each category (reproduced from Garcia et al 2020 2 under CC BY 4.0) For some of these categories the information is factual and it is obvious what to include (e.g. contact details, licence, date of last revision) but for other categories (e.g. learning outcomes, additional information) the content is more abstract and requires a little more thought. For these more abstract categories, the quality, or richness, of the information provided is important for enabling reuse. For example, in our cake analogy, if your recipe only included the title \u201cBest cake ever\u201d and a list of ingredients \u201cflour, eggs and milk\u201d and instructions to \u201ccombine and bake\u201d it would be difficult for someone to use the recipe to bake a cake. Indeed they could end up with biscuits instead of a cake! At the same time there is a balance to be struck between providing enough information to be useful and too much overwhelming detail. Let\u2019s look at \u2018learning outcomes\u2019 and \u2018additional information\u2019 in more detail. A word on keywords, ontologies and controlled vocabularies Keywords are important for boosting the findability of training materials. Where possible, keywords should be chosen from an agreed upon list of terms (i.e an ontology or controlled vocabulary) that is relevant to your field. This helps ensure that keywords are used consistently and reduces ambiguity. For biology and bioinformatics EDAM [@10.1093/bioinformatics/btt113] is an example of an ontology that includes agreed terms for data types, data identifiers, data formats, operations, and topics and you can use services like the Ontology Lookup Service to look up terms and keywords. You can learn more about ontologies in this video from the EMBL-EBI . Writing learning outcomes Writing learning outcomes in a consistent format makes them easier to understand and compare across different materials and sessions. These statements help trainees to determine if the training session is right for them. Trainers can also use them to determine if training materials cover the topics they wish to teach and if they are pitched at an appropriate level. A bonus to writing learning outcomes is that it can help you define the purpose, intended audience of your training session and what participants need to know (the prerequisites) before joining it. Learning experience: writing learning outcomes Watch this video on how to write SMART learning outcomes Now write a set of learning outcomes for your own materials. Share your learning outcomes with a friend. Are they able to tell what the goals of your training are? Providing additional contextual information Providing context about the delivery method helps other trainers plan for reuse. It\u2019s also really useful if you have to repeat the same session sometime in the future! These are the things that come under \u2018Required resources\u2019, \u2018Structure and duration\u2019 and \u2018Additional notes\u2019 in the table. For example, were these materials part of a workshop? Was the training delivered online or in person? How much time is needed for each activity? Was special software needed? Learning experience: adding contextual information Find some examples of ways in which trainers provide \u2018additional information\u2019 and context about how to use training materials. How did they include this information? What information did they include? There are several ways to include additional information. For example Carpentries lessons include \u2018Instructor notes\u2019 while this example from the Swiss Institute of Bioinformatics uses a README file in their GitHub repository to collate this information and the Australian BioCommons provides information in a table of metadata. You might even consider adding an extra slide to your slide deck when you share it. In fact what you include and how, really depends on the materials and training session in question. To write your own notes, start by thinking of this as a training love letter to yourself. If you were to reuse these materials in 2, 5, 10 years time, what else would you need to know about the session? It can be tempting to include a lot of detailed information here. Remember that you can also facilitate reuse of your materials by welcoming contributions and inviting people to get in touch if they need more information. <link to chapter on contribution> How and where to share metadata Recipes are typically written in a similar format that includes a photo of the dish alongside detailed metadata including i) a description ii) a list of ingredients iii) method/instructions. This makes it easy to quickly check if that recipe is right for you. The same is true for training materials. Sharing metadata alongside your training materials makes it quicker and easier to review the materials. How you share this metadata depends on where you are sharing it. For example, repositories such as Zenodo prompt you to add metadata by providing a form for you to fill in when you upload your materials. If your repository is not specialised for training materials or doesn\u2019t provide a form it may be necessary to add additional information in a free text format such as a README file. Whichever format you choose, use a consistent method for all of your training materials. This will save you time and make it easier to find, compare and contrast materials. Structuring metadata for machines Metadata can also be structured to help machines search and catalogue this information. For more on this see Chapter 4 . Now it\u2019s your turn to write a training recipe. Learning experience: Write your own training recipe Make a table of the types of information you need to include in your metadata (you may wish to use the table above for inspiration). Complete the table for your training material providing detailed information. Ask a friend to read your recipe.

Perhaps it is a multi-layered chocolate cake with cream and cherries on top. Believing that food is better when shared, you want to make sure that your friends and family can make it too. How would you go about doing this? You\u2019d likely start with a recipe. This recipe would include a description of the cake, a list of ingredients and equipment, and instructions on how to combine the ingredients. You might also include extra information like how many people it serves or tips on steps that can be done ahead of time. Your friend decides to bake the cake but they can\u2019t eat cherries and don\u2019t have some of the ingredients and equipment that you have. They decide to experiment by substituting ingredients and methods from another recipe to make their own perfect chocolate cake. The same is true for training. The training session can be thought of as the cake, the training materials are the ingredients, and the methods are instructions on how to combine and use the materials to deliver the training. Training materials and sessions can be (re)used in whole, in part or simply as inspiration. Regardless, when reusing training materials it is likely that they will need to be adapted to new contexts to account, for example, for different audiences and settings. To enable others to reuse your materials it\u2019s important to provide a detailed recipe.","title":"Introduction"},{"location":"chapters/chapter_07/#what-to-include-in-your-recipe","text":"Learning activity: What to include in your recipe In this activity we consider what types of information to include in a training recipe. Find three examples of training materials relevant to your field. This may be an individual training material or a training session. (Alternatively, take a look at some of the case studies linked below). What information is included in the training recipe for these materials? Is the same information provided in all three examples? Would you need more information to decide whether you could reuse them and how? Information about training sessions and materials is referred to as metadata . Metadata makes it easier for you and others to understand how a particular material or set of materials can be (re)used. Making training FAIR requires materials and sessions to be described with rich metadata. Ideally, this includes a universally agreed set of information. Many training communities, including Bioschemas and the Research Data Alliance (RDA) 1 , are working towards defining these sets of information but broad agreement on the categories to be included is yet to be reached. In our paper 10 simple rules for making training materials FAIR 2 we used the Bioschema and RDA sets to create a list of the information (metadata) that is important for training materials. Table 1: Metadata that is important for training materials and guidance on what to include in each category (reproduced from Garcia et al 2020 2 under CC BY 4.0) For some of these categories the information is factual and it is obvious what to include (e.g. contact details, licence, date of last revision) but for other categories (e.g. learning outcomes, additional information) the content is more abstract and requires a little more thought. For these more abstract categories, the quality, or richness, of the information provided is important for enabling reuse. For example, in our cake analogy, if your recipe only included the title \u201cBest cake ever\u201d and a list of ingredients \u201cflour, eggs and milk\u201d and instructions to \u201ccombine and bake\u201d it would be difficult for someone to use the recipe to bake a cake. Indeed they could end up with biscuits instead of a cake! At the same time there is a balance to be struck between providing enough information to be useful and too much overwhelming detail. Let\u2019s look at \u2018learning outcomes\u2019 and \u2018additional information\u2019 in more detail. A word on keywords, ontologies and controlled vocabularies Keywords are important for boosting the findability of training materials. Where possible, keywords should be chosen from an agreed upon list of terms (i.e an ontology or controlled vocabulary) that is relevant to your field. This helps ensure that keywords are used consistently and reduces ambiguity. For biology and bioinformatics EDAM [@10.1093/bioinformatics/btt113] is an example of an ontology that includes agreed terms for data types, data identifiers, data formats, operations, and topics and you can use services like the Ontology Lookup Service to look up terms and keywords. You can learn more about ontologies in this video from the EMBL-EBI .","title":"What to include in your recipe"},{"location":"chapters/chapter_07/#writing-learning-outcomes","text":"Writing learning outcomes in a consistent format makes them easier to understand and compare across different materials and sessions. These statements help trainees to determine if the training session is right for them. Trainers can also use them to determine if training materials cover the topics they wish to teach and if they are pitched at an appropriate level. A bonus to writing learning outcomes is that it can help you define the purpose, intended audience of your training session and what participants need to know (the prerequisites) before joining it.

It\u2019s also really useful if you have to repeat the same session sometime in the future!

For example, were these materials part of a workshop? Was the training delivered online or in person? How much time is needed for each activity? Was special software needed? Learning experience: adding contextual information Find some examples of ways in which trainers provide \u2018additional information\u2019 and context about how to use training materials. How did they include this information? What information did they include? There are several ways to include additional information. For example Carpentries lessons include \u2018Instructor notes\u2019 while this example from the Swiss Institute of Bioinformatics uses a README file in their GitHub repository to collate this information and the Australian BioCommons provides information in a table of metadata. You might even consider adding an extra slide to your slide deck when you share it. In fact what you include and how, really depends on the materials and training session in question. To write your own notes, start by thinking of this as a training love letter to yourself. If you were to reuse these materials in 2, 5, 10 years time, what else would you need to know about the session? It can be tempting to include a lot of detailed information here. Remember that you can also facilitate reuse of your materials by welcoming contributions and inviting people to get in touch if they need more information. <link to chapter on contribution>","title":"Providing additional contextual information"},{"location":"chapters/chapter_07/#how-and-where-to-share-metadata","text":"Recipes are typically written in a similar format that includes a photo of the dish alongside detailed metadata including i) a description ii) a list of ingredients iii) method/instructions. This makes it easy to quickly check if that recipe is right for you. The same is true for training materials. Sharing metadata alongside your training materials makes it quicker and easier to review the materials. How you share this metadata depends on where you are sharing it. For example, repositories such as Zenodo prompt you to add metadata by providing a form for you to fill in when you upload your materials. If your repository is not specialised for training materials or doesn\u2019t provide a form it may be necessary to add additional information in a free text format such as a README file. Whichever format you choose, use a consistent method for all of your training materials. This will save you time and make it easier to find, compare and contrast materials. Structuring metadata for machines Metadata can also be structured to help machines search and catalogue this information. For more on this see Chapter 4 .

Prerequisites Learners should have material that they would like to share and consider attaching a licence to. Learning Outcomes List the differences between the various licence schemes and licence types Describe the implications for users of materials and how this impacts on your choice What are licences and why are they required? Licences are a standardised way of giving others specific permissions to use work you created. They allow you to put your work out publicly, while providing guidance to users about how they can use your materials and whether there are any restrictions. By making your training materials public, others can benefit from your work and experience. It also benefits you as it increases the possibility of your materials being used in the way you would like and in a way that provides you with credit for your work. By attaching a licence to your materials, you get to keep some control over how they can be used. For example, you may be happy for anyone to use your materials, provided you are credited, or perhaps you would like to allow anyone to use the materials, but only if they make no changes to them. Selecting the right licence allows you to make these choices and communicate them to your users. It\u2019s important to remember that not having a licence assigned does not mean that anyone is allowed to do anything with the material, but instead creates confusion around what is allowed. Licence schemes There are many different licensing schemes available, each with different types of licences that allow you to choose what users of your materials can do with them. Some common licensing schemes include Creative Commons, MIT License, Apache, and GNU General Public License. The most common type of licence used for training materials is Creative Commons and we\u2019ll discuss these further later on in this chapter. Your choice of scheme and licence will depend on a number of factors, such as the type of materials, who the materials are targeted at, what you anticipate users wanting your materials for, any rules your institute may have already, and any materials you include within yours. Learning activity: find some examples of licences on training materials This learning activity will help you think more critically about how licences can be used. Find three examples of training materials that include a licence Do they all use the same licence scheme or type of licence? Are you clear on how you can use the materials or do you require more information? Were the licences easy to spot? Creative Commons licences There are four conditions which can be applied to your materials by Creative Commons licences 1 : Image taken from https://wiki.creativecommons.org/images/6/6d/6licenses-flat.pdf. The image is in the public domain, CC0 . These four conditions can be combined to make up six different types of Creative Commons licences for you to choose for your materials: Image taken from https://wiki.creativecommons.org/images/6/6d/6licenses-flat.pdf. The image is in the public domain, CC0 . You can label your materials with the above logos to help users quickly know which licence you have applied to your materials. Logo images are available for download from Creative Commons. There is also the option to use CC0 which allows you to put materials in the public domain, meaning users can do whatever they like with the materials, with no conditions attached. Before adding a licence to your training materials, it is important to keep in mind that licences cannot be revoked. The materials will remain covered by the licence you chose, even if you decide to stop distributing the materials later on. Learning activity: choosing a licence To help you decide which licence is most suitable for your materials, Creative Commons provides a licence chooser. In the following activity, you will try out the Creative Commons licence chooser for yourself. Select some of your training materials that you would like to add a licence to. Try the Creative Commons Licence Chooser to determine which licence is most suitable for your selected materials. Consider the licence the Chooser identified, do you think it is suitable for your materials? Remember, you may also need to consider requirements and restrictions set by your institute or company. Attaching a licence to your materials Once you have chosen a licence for your materials, you need to ensure you communicate that licence to all users of your materials. Logos and images that illustrate the chosen licence can be a great way of adding the licence to your materials. But to make sure all users understand what the licence means, you should add a link to the page that details the licence where possible. For example, if you use a CC-BY licence, link to the relevant page on the Creative Commons website. Reusing licenced materials If you wish to reuse someone else\u2019s materials you must first check that the licence they have applied to them allows it. You will also need to ensure that you recognise and cite their work appropriately ( see Chapter 10 ). The licence that you can apply to the new version of the materials depends on the original licence and how you have changed, adapted or remixed the materials. Creative Commons provides a guide on how to do this in different situations .

There are inherent benefits of sharing training material for researchers. Making training material available to learners and other instructors, the training material developers better manage their training material, ensure the training material is of high quality and take care of copyright problems. Instructors can benefit from shared training material by stimulating interest and mobilizing new potential training course participants. Thus, training material sharing can help to raise recognition and prominence of the instructor. In addition, sharing training material encourages more connection and collaboration between instructors, which can result in important new aspects within the training field. In a time of reduced investments and high interest in training, sharing of training material is more efficient because it allows instructors to share resources. Sharing training material also allows instructors to build upon the work of others rather than repeat already existing material. Despite the many benefits gained from sharing training material, there are important considerations that instructors must be aware of when sharing their training material. There are concerns that others will use the training material inappropriately or out of context. Lastly, instructors may also be uneasy about the prospect of not receiving acknowledgement by others who use their material. While these are valid concerns, often maintaining good data sharing practices can largely address many of these issues. Chapter 9.2. - Where and how should I share my training material? There are several possibilities to share your training material with the scientific community and to enhance the discoverability. The next sub-chapters show \u201cBest Practices\u201d and suitable platforms for boosting the discoverability. Chapter 9.2.1. - Sharing training material by means of TESS (https://tess.elixir-europe.org) Contributing to the overall training strategy of ELIXIR, the UK \u2018Node\u2019 piloted a Training e-Support System (TeSS) for aggregating and discovering training information across Europe and beyond since 2015. In addition, TeSS provides the latest news of ELIXIR-wide training events and materials. TeSS platform offers a \u2018shop window\u2019 to the worldwide training landscape focusing on ELIXIR training events. As a central registry, it boosts the discoverability of training activities and resources across and beyond Europe. TeSS offers an easy-to-use interface, including faceted filtering and search features to help users browse and discover training information. TeSS allows users to register their training materials manually. However, this requires significant effort to ensure that information is registered in a timely manner and updated regularly. Consequently, TeSS\u2019 primary mechanism for acquiring training metadata is to aggregate from content providers automatically. Bespoke scrapers are run daily to extract information from a range of target websites to collect different training materials. Therefore, the user has two different possibilities to upload training material to TeSS - manual and automatic. Chapter 9.2.2. - Sharing training material by means of GOBLET (mygoblet.org) The Global Organization for Bioinformatics Learning, Education and Training (GOBLET) has established a training portal, spanning the fields of bioinformatics, biocuration, biocomputing and computational biology. The portal provides a freely available collection of materials, courses, and a catalog of trainers. Materials are available under a CC BY-SA 3.0 license for download and use. Mainly, materials and courses are currently uploaded only by registered members and/or by GOBLET-affiliated trainers\u2014i.e. upload to the site requires registration with the GOBLET Foundation (this helps to minimize spurious entries and maintain quality standards). Materials may be presentations, tutorials, datasets, case studies, curricula, etc.; courses may be workshops, summer schools or road shows, and may be linked to their respective materials once uploaded to the repository. All contents are tagged: tags allow classification or filtering of entities by keyword, making them easy to find and to enhance their discoverability. The portal is an evolving resource, whose functionality and utility will grow in harmony with the evolving needs of the global life science research communities it serves, and synergistically with bioinformatics training initiatives around the world. Chapter 9.2.3. - Sharing the information about the training material upload via your social networks Social media can be an important way to promote your training material to the wider community and make it more discoverable. This can be an even more effective strategy when coming from an author or editor as an expert in the field. Below are some of the social media channels that can be recommended for promoting your training material and other channels that will offer a direct way to reach your readership. Twitter Twitter is one of the simplest social media channels to use for promotion and is an ideal way to reach new audiences and engage with the broader research and training community. Posting Guidelines: Post 2-3 times a day. Frequency is important on this platform to build a good number of followers. This can include original content, as well as retweets or links to other content. Tweets should be personal and not written in the style of a press release, marketing email etc. \u2013 you are communicating directly with individuals who can respond to you immediately. Brevity is important. Twitter limits posts to 280 characters, including links. As such, you can abbreviate, write fragments, and do not have to use proper grammar. Images and Videos \u2013 posts with images and videos are much more highly interacted with, try to ensure there is a mix of posts including images, video and just text. Link to content \u2013 it is important to always link to external content within tweets. Exceptions are when posting a question, answering someone else\u2019s tweet, or engaging in an ongoing conversation (or Twitterchat). Be aware of space \u2013 with a 280 character limit, you now have double the space to clearly communicate your thoughts. However, brevity is still king on Twitter. Start with a strong lead, and only include details that are necessary. Also remember that all links (no matter the visual length) take up 23 of your 280 characters. Schedule your tweets. Keeping an active Twitter account can be time consuming. Scheduling your Tweets in advance can help minimize your time spent. While it\u2019s important to monitor your account daily for people that are reaching out to you or to post current news pieces, you can schedule your planned tweets using free resources, such as Hootsuite. Twitter also has a scheduler native to its system. Both these options will also come with basic analytics so that you can review your successful tweets and adapt your strategy. Check your notifications for people who have followed you or mentioned you in a tweet. Always respond to these notifications as this will ensure engagement and a development of your Twitter community. If there is a negative comment, refer to the \u201cMonitoring and responding to posts\u201d section of this document. Facebook Facebook has evolved over time and now is a great place to create personal connections with others based on common interests. Join groups or like pages around training, areas of expertise, school, or workplace. Additionally, users can join groups organized by city, workplace, school, or college. You can also join and create groups according to your training material or areas of expertise. LinkedIn LinkedIn is not just for career opportunities. It is a global network of professionals with over 500 million members. You can include links to your training material when you create your profile, as part of the summary of your professional expertise and accomplishments, or on your feed. Instagram Instagram provides an opportunity to create interest in your training material through visuals. Infographics, short videos, or visual storytelling of the research journey can be shared on this platform. This platform is also unique because link sharing is not allowable in a post, only in your bio. Because of this, focus for Instagram is on engagement within the network instead of driving traffic to your training material. YouTube There is an increasing amount of traffic to training material sites via YouTube, because students use video content as an initial way of getting insights into a topic. If you already have video content relating to your training material, use this in the promotion of your training material. Blogging Blogging is both a form of academic writing as well as an effective way to reach new audiences and increase the discoverability of your training material. Academic social networking sites These social communities are a way of meeting and conversing with people who share the same training interests. These sites offer an immediate way to monitor what other people are looking at in your field of training. Other channels There are other options to draw attention to your latest training material: email your networks or post on listservs and institutions, society, or personal websites about your recent training material. Chapter 9.2.4. - Sharing the information about the training material upload via conference and posters Posters are widely used in the academic community, and most conferences include poster presentations in their program. Training posters summarize information or training concisely and attractively to help publicize it and generate a better discoverability. The poster is usually a mixture of a brief text mixed with tables, graphs, pictures, and other presentation formats. At a conference, the presenter stands by the poster display while other participants can come and view the presentation and interact with the trainer. Boost your poster: Important information should be readable from about 10 feet away Title is short and draws interest Word count of about 300 to 800 words Text is clear and to the point Use of bullets, numbering, and headlines make it easy to read Effective use of graphics, color and fonts Consistent and clean layout Includes acknowledgments, your name and institutional affiliation","title":"9.

We will define the roles of author, trainers and contributor and ways of how to attribute credit to them in the contact of training material. It will also discuss of how you can encourage others to contribute to your material. Learning outcomes At the end of this chapter you should be able to: Recognise the importance of attribution and citations Explain why it is important to encourage continuous contributions and acknowledgements Define the difference between author, trainer and contributor Define criteria for acknowledgements Define author/contributor roles based on the Contributor Roles Taxonomy (CRediT) matrix Describe ways to engage communities (trainers and trainees) to get contributions and feedback Use persistent identifiers for people in the context of attribution Describe how to capture contributors and authors depending on the repository / platform Provide credit for other training material Prerequisites Know what an ORCiD is. More information in chapter 5 Know the different file formats and tools that are around to develop, store and share training materials. More information in chapter 1 and chapter 2 Importance of attribution of credit Attributing credit is as important for training material as it is for scientific literature. While in the scientific literature authors and co-authors are listed, the following roles play an important part in the context of training material. Author Teacher / trainer Contributor In addition to this, there may also be a need to consider the funder(s) and organisation or community that enabled the development of the materials. We will define these roles in more detail in the next section and also clarify how credit is attributed for each of them. Attributing credit to these roles makes them (most often scientists) more visible, serves as a proof of their effort beyond pure research and can bring these scientists additional recognition. In addition, it clarifies the responsibilities of those who contributed to certain content of the training material and the training session and thus allows trainers who will re-use the training material to contact these people with potential follow-up questions. It makes those who contributed to the material personally accountable for their contributions. Beyond the individual author, Teacher/trainer and contributor, the funder(s), developing organisation or community play a role in the longer term maintenance of the materials. In the end, attributing contact creates a community of trainers and contributors, which not only makes your course material better, but it\u2019s also a great way together. All of the different roles are related to each other. The author(s) initiate and generate the material, and the trainer interacts with the learners. Contributors interact with the authors and trainers in order to improve the material. The community provides existing material and knowledge where the trainer, author and contributor can rely on, while at the same time the community profits from the generated material. Below there\u2019s figure representing these relationhips. Different roles and their relationships Exercise Learning experience: Search for training material online and analyse how credit is attributed and to whom. (in groups, 10 mins, 5 min search, 5 min wrap-up) Different roles The three different roles have different characteristics that you can use to define them. Each author is expected to: Have made substantial contributions in the capacity of one of the roles in the credit matrix Have approved the course version Be personally accountable for their contributions Each teacher / trainer is expected to have had interactions with learners during the respective course version as part of a didactic process. Each contributor has contributed to the course material including, but not limited to: Improvement of exercises and lectures Testing and evaluation of exercises/lectures/learner\u2019s environment Using material of others Everyone who does not meet authorship, contributor or trainer criteria but deserves so should be acknowledged. For example, persons or organisations should be cited if their course material was used as inspiration for the current course material version. The amount of acknowledgment for a piece of training materials is dependent on the amount of reuse of those materials. Sources used for teaching or training materials should, at minimum, follow academic guidelines for citation. This level of acknowledgment is appropriate in the case when a relatively small amount of materials are being used from a source in the context of other developed work. Note Minimum information for citations: Author, year, material title, version, DOI When you are citing/referencing training materials, try to follow the academic citations/reference style that you use for citing literature. To eliminate name confusion and ensure appropriate attribution to the authors and teachers, it is highly recommended to adopt ORCID iDs . Remember to cite \u201cinvisible\u201d training materials as well - e.g. quizzes, literature lists, etc. In the case where individual figures or tables are taken from a source then should be cited as and when the figure or table appears. At the other end of the spectrum, whole-scale reuse of materials, e.g. the content of an entire lecture or web-site should maintain the overall original appearance of the materials. This includes keeping any logos and branding on materials and footnotes or headers that identify the authors. A funder has provided financial support for the development of the materials. An organisation or community has coordinated the development of the materials and has undertaken to develop the materials in the longer term. If the materials have been explicitly developed with support from a grant then the grant code should also be quoted. In the table below you will find an overview of how and where you can specify different roles and citation in training materials. Table 1.

Often identical with the author, if not also listed in the description, also on the Intro page of the video In the acknowledgement or anywhere else where appropriate. Quite often videos include logos of organizations and funders. In the extended description if possible software In the README.md/metadata in the github/other repository and .zenodo.json file Often identical with the author, if not listed in the README.md/metadata As an automatic contributor of the github repository In the README.md Get cited! When you are creating training materials, provide guidelines on how to cite them and credit the authors and other contributors. If you are using a git repository, you can for example add it to a CITATION.cff file . An easy way to get a DOI and therefore a way to be cited is by registering your material to zenodo . Importance to encourage contribution It is important to encourage contribution to training material as this will allow for the training content to develop over time, and thus to be kept updated. In addition potential mistakes can be identified and corrected, thus the quality of the material will increase with more contributions. Acknowledging contributions serves as a motivation for people to provide input and will drive the formation of a community of interest. A first step in encouraging contributions would be creating a warm environment for people that are interested to work on your material. You can do that by encouraging people you that might be interested, but also online, by writing encouragements associated with your material, and provide instructions on how to contribute. In a git repository, this is typically done in a file called CONTRIBUTING.md . Credit matrix It is more and more common in scientific literature to use a matrix for clarifying contributions to a publication. Such a matrix provides a standardised list of contributor roles and allows to assign authors to these roles. One example of such a matrix is the CRediT matrix . The CRediT matrix was reworked for the purpose of training material and is provided below. It should become best practice to use such a matrix also for training materials. The CRediT matrix can be helpful in evaluating whether a person is an author or contributor. Usually an author has made a significant contribution to one or more roles in the CRediT matrix. Related to this, it can be used to describe the actual responsibilities of the different authors. CRediT role Relevance training Interpretation in training context Conceptualization Yes Concept of the course/session. E.g. defining the need Data curation Yes, where relevant Prepare and maintain course data (including software code, where it is necessary for interpreting the data itself) for initial use and later re-use.
